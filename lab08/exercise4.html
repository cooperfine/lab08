  <h id="text">I knew I would be an engineer from a young age. The question however, was what area did I want to pursue. I spent my high school career taking class that I thought I might be interested in and would pertain to a certain engineering field. Chemistry was what I disliked the most and knew right away that was not for me. The next was physics and this class I really enjoyed. After taking this class my sophmore year, I was the teachers aid my junior year. During my junior year I decided to take a programming class and knew it was for me. For the next two years I took every class related to programming I could find and fell in love with it. Now I'm a senior in Computer Engineering at Kansas University and am excited to graduate.<h>
